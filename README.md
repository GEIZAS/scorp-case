# scorp-case

# This project developed using Vue.JS with Vuetify Framework

# 1) I fixed page reload issue after language change.

# 2) Mobile hamburger menu icon is changed when menu's state true/false.

# 3) At Contact Page, phone number field edited to only number field and 10 characters controls.

# 4) At Contract Page, fixed misspelled "send" button as "login".

# One more note: Actually creating a PageTemplate; I planned the AppBar, Footer etc. objects to be included in the MainLayout. But I created all the content in PageTemplate and only created "router-view" in MainLayout. Unfortunately, I realized my mistake late and did not have time to correct it.

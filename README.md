# scorp-case

# I guess only it's just missing the "apply language switch operation without page refresh" step. According to my research the language change is not applied without restarting Vue Instance. But after the delivery of this project, I plan to continue my research and learn.

# One more note: Actually creating a PageTemplate; I planned the AppBar, Footer etc. objects to be included in the MainLayout. But I created all the content in PageTemplate and only created "router-view" in MainLayout. Unfortunately, I realized my mistake late and did not have time to correct it.
